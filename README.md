# Extended-precision-in-Delphi
Modifying files in Delphi library to compile with Extended Precision

In my previous repository I made a calculator to convert floating point values in ten bytes FPU format, into the real number they represent and vice versa.

To do this, I made a FPU asm code to replace the code after compiling the calculator Delphi program, because Windows programs work inside with extended precision (80 bits), but only present data in doubled precision (64 bits). Extended precision woks with data until 18 decimal digits, and I have gotten even one more 19!

In this repository a have modified the files Delphi uses to compile the function FloatToStr (convert a floating valaue in a string) to get the maximum possible precision.

I have modified my old delphi from 2006 ( Version 10.0.2558.35231 ) the file is: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Delphi 10\lib\SysUtils.dcu"

Ihave modified too my new versi√≥n (Delphi 10.4 Version 27.0.40680.4203 ) the file is located in: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Embarcadero\Studio\21.0\lib\win32\release\System.SysUtils.dcu"

The offset may vary in other versions, and the files my have other (similar) name and have a different path, but the procedure is the same: find the bytes and replace them with the new ones.

Added program file SysUtilsPatch42.exe (and a new branch with the delphi project). Read the Help into the program to Know how to use it.
